# MarkLogic Content Pump and Hadoop Connector

The project contains MarkLogic Content Pump (MLCP) and MarkLogic Hadoop Connector. 

## Features

MLCP is a command-line tool providing the fastest way to import, export, and copy data to or from MarkLogic databases. Core features of MLCP include:

* Bulk load billions of local files
* Split and load large, aggregate XML files or delimited text
* Bulk load billions of triples or quads from RDF files
* Archive and restore database contents across environments
* Copy subsets of data between databases
* Load documents from HDFS, including Hadoop SequenceFiles
* Leverage Hadoop infrastructure to do above jobs 

Hadoop Connector is an extension to Hadoop's MapReduce framework that allows you to easily and efficiently communicate with a MarkLogic database from within a MapReduce job. Core features of Hadoop Connector include:

* Leverage existing MapReduce and Java libraries to process MarkLogic data
* Operate on data as Documents, Nodes, or Values
* Access MarkLogic text, geospatial, value, and document structure indexes to send only the most relevant data to Hadoop for processing
* Send Hadoop Reduce results to multiple MarkLogic forests in parallel
* Rely on the connector to optimize data access (for both locality and streaming IO) across MarkLogic forests

## How to Build

Requirements to build MLCP and Hadoop Connector

- [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven version later than 3.03](https://maven.apache.org/)

MLCP and Hadoop Connector can be built together. In root directory run
``` bash
$ mvn clean package
```
After successful build, product packages can be found in **deliverable** directory of **mlcp** and **mapreduce** directory.

Alternatively, MLCP and Hadoop Connector can be built separately from their own root directory (**mlcp** and **mapreduce**) with above command. Note that MLCP has a dependency on Hadoop Connector. So successfull build of Hadoop Connector is required for building MLCP. 

For information on contributing to this project see [CONTRIBUTING.md](). For information on working on development of this project see [project wiki page]().


## Run Tests

Both MLCP and Hadoop Connector come with unit tests that cover basic functionality of the products. **Please build the products before running tests as some tests rely on built binaries.**

``` bash
$ mvn clean package
$ mvn test -DskipTests=false
```
