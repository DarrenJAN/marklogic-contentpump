Run as root which already has passwordless ssh set up for localhost and hosts in HOSTLISTFILE
./install.sh --hosts HOSTLISTFILE

2. Separate Installation of mlcp and connector
Run as root which already has passwordless ssh setup for localhost and hosts in HOSTLISTFILE
Or run as a user which has sudo. May need to manually input password.

cd utility
./install-mlcp-connector.sh --hosts HOSTLISTFILE

3. Remove mlcp, MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop and XCC
cd utility
./remove-mlcp-connector.sh [ --hosts HOSTLISTFILE ]
