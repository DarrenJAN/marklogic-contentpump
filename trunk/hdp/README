1. Installation of mlcp and connector
Run as root which already has passwordless ssh setup for localhost and hosts in HOSTLISTFILE
Or run as a user which has sudo. May need to manually input password.

./install.sh --hosts HOSTLISTFILE

2. Remove mlcp, MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop and XCC
utility/remove-mlcp-connector.sh [ --hosts HOSTLISTFILE ]
if --hosts HOSTLISTFILE is not specified, only remove mlcp from localhost
