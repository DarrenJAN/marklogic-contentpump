1. Installation of HDP, mlcp and connector
Run as root which already has passwordless ssh setup for localhost and hosts in HOSTLISTFILE


2. Separate Installation of mlcp and connector
Run as root which already has passwordless ssh setup for localhost and hosts in HOSTLISTFILE
Or run as a user which has sudo. May need to manually input password.

cd utility
./install-mlcp-connector.sh --hosts HOSTLISTFILE

3. Remove mlcp, MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop and XCC
cd utility
./remove-mlcp-connector.sh [ --hosts HOSTLISTFILE ]
if --hosts HOSTLISTFILE is not specified, only remove mlcp from localhost
