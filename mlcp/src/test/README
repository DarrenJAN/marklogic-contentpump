*Configurations*

To run unit tests, the following configurations on MarkLogic Server are required:
1) MarkLogic Server runs on localhost
2) a XDBC server with port 5275 is required to associate with Documents database;
   use "/" for the root and the Modules database for modules.
3) create database "CopyDst"
4) create a forest, and attach it to database "CopyDst" 
5) create a XDBC server with port 6275 associated with database "CopyDst";
   use "/" for the root and the Modules database for modules.

hadoop runs on localhost

Check out mlcp source code to some directory, say MLCP_HOME.
Modify MLCP_HOME/src/conf/test.properties
1) set HADOOP_CONF_DIR to the hadoop's conf directory 
2) set OUT_PATH to some temporary path for output
3) set HADOOP to 1 or 2 or 2.0.4(depending on the version of your hadoop server)
4) set CONTENTPUMP_VERSION=1.2 or 1.3 (b7 is 1.2, trunk is 1.3)


*Run tests*

Run all tests on Linux:
first make sure HADOOP_CONF_DIR has been unset, then
mvn test -DskipTests=false

Run all tests (tests for distributed mode excluded) on Linux:
mvn test -DskipTests=false -Plocal

Run a specific test on Linux:
mvn test -DskipTests=false  -Dtest=TestImportDelimitedText

As Windows is not supported for mlcp distributed mode, use the following command to 
skip tests for distributed mode on Windows:
mvn.bat test -DskipTests=false -Plocal

By default, it will build and test using hadoop1's libraries; to test using hadoop2, append the following to the mvn command:
-Dhadoop-deps.version=2
