(ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) 
beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions 
granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but 
not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made 
available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or 
attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is 
based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, 
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original 
work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not 
include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the 
interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of 
the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, 
that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright 
owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the 
copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of 
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its 
representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing 
lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or

excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in 
writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom 
a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the 
Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-
charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative 
Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and 
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each 
Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, 
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, 
have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where 
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that 
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You 
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or 
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated 
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any 
patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of 
the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative 
Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object 
form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this 
License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You 
changed the files; and

(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, 
all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the 
Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; 
and

(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any 
Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution 
notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain 
to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 
NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form 
or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display 
generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally 
appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not 
modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works 
that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, 
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the 
License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide 
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or 
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, 
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with 
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any 
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor 
shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms 
or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the 
terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding 
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for 
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the 
content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, 
Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS 
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, 
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely 
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work 
and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law 
(such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to 
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any 
and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised 
of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or 
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of 
support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your 
own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, 
and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any 
liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your 
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Eigen is Free Software. Starting from the 3.1.1 version, it is licensed under the 
MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common questions about the MPL2 are 
answered in the official MPL2 FAQ.
Earlier versions were licensed under the LGPL3+.
Note that currently, a few features rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: 
SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained_cg. Such features can be explicitly 
disabled by compiling with the EIGEN_MPL2_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined. 
Furthermore, Eigen provides interface classes for various third-party libraries 
(usually recognizable by the <Eigen/*Support> header name). Of course you have to mind 
the license of the so-included library when using them.
Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use 
Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-
source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed 
projects.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and 
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the 
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an 
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, 
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class 
defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the 
Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made 
is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source 
for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work 
that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked 
Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or 
source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries 
of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being 
bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to 
a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than 
as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in 
the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still 
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file 
that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your 
choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical 
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in 
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works. 
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in 
the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you 
also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used 
in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the 
copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing 
the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

d) Do one of the following:

0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the 
Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, 
the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked 
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of 
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable 
mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on 
the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to 
provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that 
such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the 
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified 
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information 
must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If 
you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner 
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries. 
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in 
a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and 
are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of 
your choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, 
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this 
License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on 
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received 
it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the 
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version 
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future 
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent 
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other 
kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a 
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free 
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it 
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute 
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of 
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or 
asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if 
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to 
respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these 
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert 
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission 
to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires 
that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be 
attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of 
the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally 
incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The 
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to 
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems 
arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those 
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not 
allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose 
computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents 
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the 
GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

Copyright also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as 
semiconductor masks.

The Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each 
licensee is addressed as you. Licensees and recipients may be individuals or 
organizations.

To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion 
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting 
work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the 
earlier work.

A covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would 
make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright 
law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation 
includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or 
receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no 
transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices to the extent that 
it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an 
appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the 
work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey 
the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the 
list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code. 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. Object code means any non-source form of a work.

A Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined 
by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a 
particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in 
that language.

The System Libraries of an executable work include anything, other than the work as 
a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but 
which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the 
work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A Major Component, in 
this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of 
the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a 
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the source code 
needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to 
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not 
include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available 
free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition 
files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared 
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to 
require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those 
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions. 
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the 
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License 
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output 
from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use 
or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without 
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered 
works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for 
you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply 
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control 
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so 
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit 
them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship 
with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions 
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. 
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty 
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention 
of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising 
rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any 
intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, 
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention 
of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any 
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and 
any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact 
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this 
License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from 
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that 
you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a 
relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this 
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the 
requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who 
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the 
work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal 
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display 
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are 
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it 
such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium, is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are 
not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what 
the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not 
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the 
terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical 
distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable 
physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical 
distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years 
and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product 
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the 
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this 
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a 
price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of 
source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no 
charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to 
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and 
noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in 
accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a 
charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way 
through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy 
the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object 
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server 
(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, 
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find 
the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, 
you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy 
these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other 
peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to 
the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object 
code work.

A User Product is either (1) a consumer product, which means any tangible personal 
property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) 
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a 
product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, normally used refers to a 
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the 
particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects 
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of 
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

Installation Information for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified 
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its 
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued 
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with 
solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for 
use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the 
right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in 
perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), 
the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the 
Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any 
third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product 
(for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to 
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been 
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been 
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself 
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules 
and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with 
this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an 
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no 
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms. 
Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making 
exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are 
applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this 
License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional 
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under 
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without 
regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be 
written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You 
may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for 
which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered 
work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the 
terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 
15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions 
in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; 
or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that 
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the 
original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the 
material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who 
conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of 
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions 
directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within 
the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, 
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that 
is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may 
add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, 
provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the 
relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, 
or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a 
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply 
either way.

8. Termination. 
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses 
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the 
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, 
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means 
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if 
the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is 
the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) 
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your 
receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of 
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights 
have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new 
licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the 
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of 
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require 
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to 
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this 
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this 
License.

An entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging 
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, 
each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever 
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the 
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work 
from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with 
reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or 
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, 
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not 
initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or 
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents. 
A contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the 
Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the 
contributor's contributor version.

A contributor's essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by 
the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be 
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its 
contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a 
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license 
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, 
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor 
version.

In the following three paragraphs, a patent license is any express agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To 
grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment 
not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the 
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge 
and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or 
other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding 
Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with 
the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream 
recipients. Knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that, but for the 
patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use 
of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in 
that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, 
or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to 
some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, 
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based 
on it.

A patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its 
coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or 
more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not 
convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is 
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third 
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the 
third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, 
a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work 
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in 
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, 
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 
28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied 
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under 
applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions 
of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey 
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be 
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or 
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero 
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. 
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered 
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 
13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a 
certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License or any later version 
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU 
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a 
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no 
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of 
your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability. 
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be 
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local 
law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in 
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies 
a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to 
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone 
can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to 
the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full 
notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the 
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, 
either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this 
program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode:

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of 
the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for 
a GUI interface, you would use an about box.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to 
sign a copyright disclaimer for the program, if necessary. For more information on 
this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it 
more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is 
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this 
License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. 
DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE 
COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES 
RESULTING FROM ITS USE.
License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER 
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR 
COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND 
BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN 
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or 
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a 
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in 
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a 
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the 
purposes of this License.

b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-
existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, 
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, 
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, 
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will 
not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance 
of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the 
synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be 
considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of 
this License.

d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this 
License.

f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has 
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has 
received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License 
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict 
any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive 
rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby 
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of 
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, 
and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and 
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as 
incorporated in Collective Works;

d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and 
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right 
to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, 
SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. 
webcast) of the Work.

ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to 
collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. 
Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover 
version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 
115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether 
individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for 
the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory 
license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in 
other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or 
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as 
are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All 
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to 
and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, 
or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of 
the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the 
terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You 
may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this 
License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, 
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological 
measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the 
terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a 
Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work 
itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective 
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from 
the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create 
a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, 
remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.

b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally 
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all 
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are 
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if 
supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party 
or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in 
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name 
of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably 
practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be 
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or 
licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit 
identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of 
the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original 
Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, 
that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit 
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at 
least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE 
WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, 
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF 
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE 
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO 
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF 
THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 
breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received 
Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not 
have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full 
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any 
termination of this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual 
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to 
stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in 
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective 
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and 
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor 
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and 
conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision 
valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented 
to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be 
charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to 
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations 
with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any 
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may 
not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in 
connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on 
any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, 
special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly 
identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations 
of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed 
under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark "Creative Commons" or any related 
trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative 
Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current 
trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made 
available upon request from time to time.

ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-
existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of 
music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance 
and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be 
recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the 
original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an 
Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work 
is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-
relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the 
purpose of this License.

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as 
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other 
works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by 
reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual 
creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with 
one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in 
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for 
the purposes of this License.

c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the 
Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the 
Work under the terms of this License.

e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the 
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual 
or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a 
performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, 
deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works 
or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the 
person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; 
and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this 
License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and 
artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital 
form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other 
work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or 
entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a 
cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous 
to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or 
lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process 
analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or 
three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a 
performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is 
protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus 
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has 
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has 
received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License 
despite a previous violation.

h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to 
communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including 
by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the 
public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a 
place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by 
any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the 
Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work 
by any means including signs, sounds or images.

i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without 
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing 
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in 
digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or 
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions 
that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law 
or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby 
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of 
the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to 
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including 
any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or 
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a 
translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to 
Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in 
Collections; and,

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right 
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be 
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any 
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to 
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, 
the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by 
You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, 
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting 
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any 
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or 
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as 
are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject 
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to 
and limited by the following restrictions:

a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this 
License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, 
this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may 
not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or 
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that 
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must 
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties 
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or 
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on 
the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) 
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the 
Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. 
If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as 
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), 
as requested.

b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, 
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all 
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are 
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if 
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or 
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution 
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other 
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if 
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor 
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with 
Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work 
in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this 
Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in 
the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a 
credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as 
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the 
other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit 
required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above 
and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or 
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the 
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your 
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the 
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise 
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work 
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, 
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would 
be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in 
those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in 
Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a 
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the 
Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as 
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national 
law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this 
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE 
WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, 
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF 
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE 
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO 
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF 
THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 
breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received 
Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their 
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance 
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of 
this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual 
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to 
stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in 
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor 
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the 
license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the 
recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the 
license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision 
valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented 
to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be 
charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement 
between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no 
understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified 
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any 
communication from You.

e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the 
Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were 
drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 
1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty 
of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These 
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the 
License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of 
the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the 
standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional 
rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be 
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any 
rights under applicable law.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor 
of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your 
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated 
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other 
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think 
carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and 
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these 
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate 
to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you 
must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that 
they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) 
we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or 
modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty 
for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, 
the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that 
the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. 
We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free 
program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist 
that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with 
the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General 
Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to 
certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, 
the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the 
original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking 
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public 
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to 
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides 
other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. 
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest 
possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve 
this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, 
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use 
the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a 
greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission 
to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the 
whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, 
it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the 
freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the 
Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 
Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a 
"work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, 
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it 
may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called 
"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be 
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and 
data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been 
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is 
not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what 
the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your 
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third 
parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be 
supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument 
passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility 
still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is 
entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d 
requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still 
compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of 
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, 
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions 
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead 
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the 
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General 
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can 
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the 
ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative 
works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a 
program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a 
"work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of 
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable 
that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), 
rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of 
the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even 
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the 
work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and 
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), 
then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object 
code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work 
also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that 
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the 
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for 
debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in 
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a 
copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you 
must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for 
the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as 
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then 
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library 
will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable 
mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on 
the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, 
and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user 
installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version 
that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more 
than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same 
place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you 
have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include 
any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, 
as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that 
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other 
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a 
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable 
that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side 
in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this 
License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, 
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms 
of the Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a 
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined 
form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except 
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, 
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long 
as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, 
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its 
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and 
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You 
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or 
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you 
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License 
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a 
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other 
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the 
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence 
of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who 
places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a 
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have 
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the 
Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose 
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision 
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of 
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to 
the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and 
change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, 
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to 
where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. 
Copyright (C) year name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the 
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with 
this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, 
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by 
electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if 
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; 
alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service

Last Modified: December __, 2015

Thanks for using Google Maps and Google Earth ("Google Maps/Google Earth").

Google Maps/Google Earth allow you to view and use a variety of content, including map 
and terrain data, imagery, business listings, traffic, reviews, and other related 
information provided by Google, its licensors, and users (the "Content").

By accessing, downloading, or using Google Maps/Google Earth, you are agreeing to:

the Google Terms of Service (the "Universal Terms");
these Maps/Google Earth additional terms (the "Maps/Earth Additional Terms");
the Google Maps/Google Earth Legal Notices (the "Legal Notices"); and
the Google Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy").
Please read each of these four documents carefully, starting with the Universal Terms. 
The Universal Terms clarify, for example, your intellectual property ownership rights 
in the content you upload, and your responsibilities when using Google content or 
third-party content or when using Google Maps/Google Earth while driving.

Collectively, we refer to the Universal Terms, the Maps/Earth Additional Terms, the 
Legal Notices, and the Privacy Policy as the "Agreement". The Agreement is a binding 
contract between you and Google regarding your use of Google Maps/Google Earth.

License. Subject to the Agreement's terms, Google grants you a non-exclusive, non-
transferable license to use Google Maps/Google Earth, including features that allow 
you to:

view and annotate maps;

create KML files and map layers;

publicly display Content with proper attribution online, in video, and in print; and

do many other things described in the Using Google Maps, Google Earth, and Street View 
permissions page.

Prohibited Conduct. When using Google Maps/Google Earth, you may not (or allow those 
acting on your behalf to):

redistribute or sell any part of Google Maps/Google Earth or create a new product or 
service based on Google Maps/Google Earth (unless you use the Google Maps/Google Earth 
APIs in accordance with their terms of service);

copy the Content (unless you are otherwise permitted to do so by the Using Google 
Maps, Google Earth, and Street View permissions page or applicable intellectual 
property law, including "fair use");

mass download or create bulk feeds of the Content (or let anyone else do so);

use Google Maps/Google Earth to create or augment any other mapping-related dataset 
(including a mapping or navigation dataset, business listings database, mailing list, 
or telemarketing list) for use in a service that is a substitute for, or a 
substantially similar service to, Google Maps/Google Earth;

use any part of Google Maps/Google Earth with other people's products or services for 
or in connection with real-time navigation or autonomous vehicle control, except 
through a specific Google-provided feature such as Android Auto or Send to Car;

reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from Google Maps/Google Earth 
or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly 
prohibited by applicable law;

remove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any links to or notices of 
those terms, or any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or

do anything inappropriate, illegal, or in violation of others' rights (including their 
privacy, publicity, and intellectual property rights).

Actual Conditions; Assumption of Risk. When you use Google Maps/Google Earth's map 
data, traffic, directions, and other Content, you may find that actual conditions 
differ from the map results and Content, so exercise your independent judgment and use 
Google Maps/Google Earth at your own risk. Youre responsible at all times for your 
conduct and its consequences.

Your Content in Google Maps/Google Earth. Content you upload, submit, store, send, or 
receive through Google Maps/Google Earth is subject to Googles Universal Terms, 
including the license in the section entitled Your Content in our Services. However, 
content that remains exclusively local to your device (such as a locally-stored KML 
file) is not uploaded or submitted to Google, and is therefore not subject to that 
license.

Government Users. If you are using our Services on behalf of a government entity, the 
following terms apply:

Government Uses of Our Services. The Universal Terms section entitled Business uses 
of our Services is replaced in its entirety with the following:

If you are using our Services on behalf of a government entity, that entity accepts 
these terms. Solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, regulation, or 
privileges and immunities, that entity will hold harmless and indemnify Google and its 
affiliates, officers, agents and employees from any claim, action or proceedings 
arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, 
including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgements, 
litigation costs and legal fees.

Governing Law.

For city or state government entities in the United States and European Union, the 
Universal Terms section regarding governing law and venue will not apply.

For United States federal government entities, the Universal Terms section regarding 
governing law and venue is replaced in its entirety with the following:

This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with 
the laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. Solely 
to the extent permitted by federal law: (A) the laws of the State of California 
(excluding Californias conflict of laws rules) will apply in the absence of 
applicable federal law; and (B) any dispute arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal courts of Santa 
Clara County, California, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those 
courts.

U.S. Government Restricted Rights. All access or use of Google Maps/Google Earth by or 
for the United States federal government is subject to the "U.S. Government Restricted 
Rights" section in the Legal Notices.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that 
Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be 
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software 
in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form 
in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms 
of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original 
creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.

3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial 
Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that 
alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights 
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this 
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. 
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or 
new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than 
the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY 
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED 
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) 
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the 
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the 
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice 
period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a 
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR 
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, 
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL 
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is 
defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software 
documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent 
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth 
herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other 
FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer 
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If 
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), 
excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court 
costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall 
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You 
alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration 
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when 
You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for 
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights 
under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works.  The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license.  The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

 

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such.
This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,in
   Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
   in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
   binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
   corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the
   primary font name as presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the 
appropriate systems
computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating 
system, browser and name and
version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you 
installed the software.
Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
 Windows Update Feature. You may connect new hardware to the device where you 
installed the software.
Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, 
the update feature of
the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your 
device. You can switch off this
update feature.
 Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from 
Microsoft and provide it to
you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating 
system, name and version
of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where 
you installed the
software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online 
assistance and Appshelp.
You may choose not to use these web content features.
 Real Simple Syndication (RSS) Feed. This software start page contains updated 
content that is supplied by
means of an RSS feed online from Microsoft.
b. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that 
could harm them or impair
anyone elses use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized 
access to any service, data,
account or network by any means.

7. .NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE. The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework software. 
This software is part of
Windows. The license terms for Windows apply to your use of the .NET Framework 
software.
8. MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING. The software includes the .NET 
Framework component
of the Windows operating systems (.NET Component). You may conduct internal 
benchmark testing of the .NET
Component. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, 
provided that you comply
with the following terms: (1) you must disclose all the information necessary for 
replication of the tests, including
complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test 
scripts/cases, tuning parameters
applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any 
third party testing tool used to
conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is 
developed by or for you and
used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s); (2) you must 
disclose the date (s) that
you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all 
Microsoft software products tested,
including the .NET Component; (3) your benchmark testing was performed using all

web sites, and uses the latest
updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft 
operating system; (4) it shall be
sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available 
location such as a website, so long as
every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the 
public site containing all required
disclosures; and (5) nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other 
right that you may have to conduct
benchmark testing. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the 
results of any customized
benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under 
confidentiality in conjunction with a bid
request by a prospective customer, such customers application(s) are specifically 
tested and the results are only
disclosed to such specific customer. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have 
with Microsoft, if you disclose
such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of 
benchmark tests it conducts of your
products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same 
conditions above.

any losses; or
 Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so the above limitation or
exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country 
may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 1.0
1. Definitions.

1.1. ``Contributor'' means each entity that creates or contributes to the creation of

1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original Code, prior 
Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by that particular 
Contributor.

1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the combination of 
the Original Code and Modifications, in each case including portions thereof.

1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally accepted in the 
software development community for the electronic transfer of data.

1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source Code.

Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A.

1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof with 
code not governed by the terms of this License.

1.8. ``License'' means this document.

1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the substance or 
structure of either the Original Code or any previous Modifications. When Covered Code

A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Original Code or 
previous Modifications.

B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous Modifications.

1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code which is described 
in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as Original Code, and which, at the 
time of its release under this License is not already Covered Code governed by this 
License.

1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for making 
modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an 
Executable, or a list of source code differential comparisons against either the 
Original Code or another well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's 
choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the 
appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and 
complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License 
issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, ``You'' includes any entity which 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For purposes of this 
definition, ``control'' means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the 
direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) 
ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial 
ownership of such entity.

2. Source Code License.

2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. 
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a 
Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, 
have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the Original Code (or portions thereof), but 
solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to 
Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may 
be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

2.2. Contributor Grant. 
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, 
subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an 
unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger 
Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the 
Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such 
patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or 
portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize 
further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License. 
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the 
terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code 
version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a 
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy 
of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer 
or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include 
an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in 
Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an 
Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to 
whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after 
the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent 
version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. 
You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even 
if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications. 
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting 
the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must 
include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or 
indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the 
name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an 
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or 
ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims. 
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular 
functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text 
file with the source code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and 
the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to 
contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as 
described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You 
make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate 
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs. 
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control 
patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include 
this information in the LEGAL file.

3.5. Required Notices. 
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this 
License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' 
rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may 
add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not 
possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, 
then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) 
where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and 
to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or 
more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and 
not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by 
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every 
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as 
a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 
3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that 
the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this 
License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations 
of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an 
Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe 
recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit 
or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth 
in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license 
You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are 
offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms 
You offer.

3.7. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by 
the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such 
a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the 
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: 
(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) 
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included 
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions 
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such 
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able 
to understand it.

5. Application of this License. 
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in 
Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions. 
Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new 
versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing 
version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions. 
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You 
may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to 
use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms 
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works. 
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in 
order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), 
you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', 
``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear 
anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the 
license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape 
Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 
Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to 
be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF 
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT 
THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR 
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE 
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY 
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL 
PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION. 
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail 
to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming 
aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted 
shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must 
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF 
ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK 
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR 
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer software'' and ``commercial computer 
software documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 
1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set 
forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS. 
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If 
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, 
provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to 
disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or 
registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless otherwise 
agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any dispute 
relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding 
arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any 
arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, 
California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to 
this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the 
Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs 
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any 
law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed 
against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You 
are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization 
of rights under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made 
available, the revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant 
factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an 
equitable basis.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS 
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER 
APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR 
COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND

existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of 
music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance 
and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be 
recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the 
original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an 
Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work 
is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-
relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the 
purpose of this License.

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as 
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other 
works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by 
reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual 
creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with 
one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in 
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that 
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for 
the purposes of this License.

c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at 
http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by Creative 
Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, 
because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and 
effect as the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the 
relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that license under this 
License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as 
this License.

d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the 
Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as selected by

three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a 
performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is 
protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus 
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has 
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has 
received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License 
despite a previous violation.

j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to 
communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including 
by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the 
public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a 
place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by 
any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the 
Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work 
by any means including signs, sounds or images.

k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without 
limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing 
fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in 
digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or 
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions 
that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law 
or other applicable laws.

Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including 
any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or 
otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a 
translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to 
Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";

c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in 
Collections; and,

d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

e. For the avoidance of doubt:

i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right 
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be 
waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any 
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;

ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to 
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, 
the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by 
You of the rights granted under this License; and,

iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, 
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting 
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any 
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or 
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as 
are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject 
to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to 
and limited by the following restrictions:

License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, 
this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may 
not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or 
the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that 
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must 
keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties 
with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or 
Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on 
the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) 
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the 
Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. 
If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as 
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the 
extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), 
as requested.

b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) 
this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as 
this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later 
license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., 
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you 
license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply 
with the terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any 
of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must 
comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following 
provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License 
with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may 
not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the 
Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You 
must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the 
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You 
Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the 
Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation 
that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the 
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This 
Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does 
not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the 
terms of the Applicable License.

c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, 
You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all 
copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are 
utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if 
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or 
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution 
("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other 
reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if 
supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor 
specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the 
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with 
Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work 
in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or 
"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this 
Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in 
the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a 
credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as 
part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the 
other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit 
required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above 
and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or 
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the 
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your 
use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the 
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise 
permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work 
either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, 
mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would 
be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in 
those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in 
Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a 
distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the 
Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as 
appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national 
law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this 
License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE 
WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, 
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF 
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE 
ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, 
WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO 
EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF 
THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any 
breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received 
Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their 
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance 
with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of 
this License.

b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual 
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, 
Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to 
stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required 
to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in 
full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor 
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the 
license granted to You under this License.

b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the 
recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the 
license granted to You under this License.

c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such 
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision 
valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented 
to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be 
charged with such waiver or consent.

e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to 
the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations 
with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any 
additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may 
not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were 
drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 
1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty 
of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These 
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the 
License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of 
the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the 
standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional 
rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be 
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any 
rights under applicable law.

(CCAL v2.5)
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License Text (http://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-1.0)
Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE 
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES 
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed 
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it 
was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such 
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) 
are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under 
their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined 
with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all 
Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the 
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code 
and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, 
use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the 
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes 
such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not 
apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its 
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the 
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any 
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought 
by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or 
otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is 
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's 
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright 
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this 
Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own 
license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, 
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, 
and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular 
purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, 
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as 
lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that 
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and 
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, 
in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of 
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect 
to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to 
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program 
in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create 
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the 
Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") 
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified 
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the 
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such 
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any 
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the 
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense 
and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate 
in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, 
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial 
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, 
those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and 
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a 
result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is 
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the 
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this 
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), 
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, 
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall 
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim 
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations 
of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), 
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with 
any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such 
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If 
all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, 
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to 
avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the 
following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions 
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the 
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is 
the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to 
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the 
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under 
which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under 
the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient 
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under 
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights 
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual 
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a 
legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. 
Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
    not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
    more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
    type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
License instead of this License.


"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  are subject to
the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where
Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception
as provided by Sun in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

AppleJavaExtensions v 1.2

This is a pluggable jar of stub classes representing the new Apple eAWT and eIO APIs 
for Java 1.4 on Mac OS X.  The purpose of these stubs is to allow for compilation of 
eAWT- or eIO-referencing code on platforms other than Mac OS X.  The jar file is 
enclosed in a zip archive for easy expansion on other platforms.  

These stubs are not intended for the runtime classpath on non-Mac platforms.  Please 
see the OSXAdapter sample for how to write cross-platform code that uses eAWT.

The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
    not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
    more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
    type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
License instead of this License.


"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  are subject to
the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where
Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception
as provided by Sun in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License Text (https://spdx.org/licenses/Artistic-1.0-Perl.html)
The "Artistic License"
Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be 
copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control 
over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right 
to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right 
to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and 
derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been 
modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, 
duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to 
justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a 
market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may 
be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may 
redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard 
Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the 
original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the 
Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall 
still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you 
insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that 
file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely 
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or 
placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing 
the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the 
Package. 
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization. 
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard 
executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each 
non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard 
Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, 
provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with 
instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version. 
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with 
your modifications. 
c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the 
differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to 
get the Standard Version. 
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You 
may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee 
for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with 
other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) 
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of 
your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by 
linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the 
complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the 
programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this 
Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may 
be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with 
this Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary 
executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a 
distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 
and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard 
Version of this Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by 
you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the 
language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are 
the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change 
the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the 
language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted 
provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is 
made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial 
distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products 
derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your 
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software 
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some 
other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public 
License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute 
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use 
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you 
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to 
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you 
modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that 
they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so 
they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you 
this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone 
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is 
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they 
have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect 
on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to 
avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent 
licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it 
clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by 
the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General 
Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work 
based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim 
or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, 
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee 
is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, 
and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work 
based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether 
that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish 
on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the 
Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your 
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.

b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part 
contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole 
at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must 
cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to 
print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a 
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and 
that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive 
but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is 
not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of 
that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, 
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions 
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in 
object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that 
you also do one of the following:

a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily 
used for software interchange; or,

b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any 
third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source 
distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
software interchange; or,

c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form 
with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus 
the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, 
as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is 
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the 
same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are 
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or 
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under 
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, 
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its 
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and 
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this 
License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or 
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you 
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License 
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a 
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other 
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the 
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence 
of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who 
places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General 
Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the 
present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a 
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have 
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not 
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by 
the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose 
distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free 
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free 
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to 
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone 
can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to 
the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; 
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the 
full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) yyyy

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this 
program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street,

electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts 
in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with 
ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are 
welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of 
the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something 
other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--
whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if 
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; 
alter the names:

License for the JUnit package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as 
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims 
infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that 
Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be 
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software 
in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form 
in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms 
of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original 
creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.

3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial 
Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that 
alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this 
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. 
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of 
this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version 
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has 
the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY 
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED 
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) 
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the 
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the 
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice 
period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a 
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the 
Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR 
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, 
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that term is 
defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software 
documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent 
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth 
herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other 
FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer 
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If 
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), 
excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court 
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall 
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You 
alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration 
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when 
You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for 
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights 
under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) 
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern 
District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue 
lying in Santa Clara County, California.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and 
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the 
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an 
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, 
but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class 
defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the 
Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made 
is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source 
for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work 
that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked 
Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or 
source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries 
of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being 
bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to 
a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than 
as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the 
modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in 
the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still 
operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file 
that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your 
choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical 
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions 
and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in 
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works. 
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in 
the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you 
also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used 
in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the 
copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing 
the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

d) Do one of the following:

0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the 
Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, 
the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked 
Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of 
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable 
mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on 
the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to 
provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that 
such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the 
Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified 
version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information 
must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If 
you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner 
specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries. 
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in 
a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and 
are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of 
your choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, 
uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this 
License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on 
the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received 
it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License 
"or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the 
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version 
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future 
versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent 
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other 
kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public 
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a 
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free 
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it 
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General 
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute 
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of 
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or 
asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if 
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to 
respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, 
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make 
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these 
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert 
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission 
to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no 
warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires 
that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be 
attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of 
the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally 
incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The 
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to 
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems 
arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those 
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not 
allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose 
computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents 
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the 
GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

Copyright also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as 
semiconductor masks.

The Program refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each 
licensee is addressed as you. Licensees and recipients may be individuals or 
organizations.

To modify a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion 
requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting 
work is called a modified version of the earlier work or a work based on the 
earlier work.

A covered work means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To propagate a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would 
make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright 
law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation 
includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To convey a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or 
receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no 
transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays Appropriate Legal Notices to the extent that 
it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an 
appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the 
work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey 
the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the 
list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code. 
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. Object code means any non-source form of a work.

A Standard Interface means an interface that either is an official standard defined 
by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a 
particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in 
that language.

The System Libraries of an executable work include anything, other than the work as 
a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but 
which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the 
work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A Major Component, in 
this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of 
the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a 
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The Corresponding Source for a work in object code form means all the source code 
needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to 
modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not 
include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available 
free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition 
files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared 
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to 
require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those 
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate 
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions. 
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the 
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License 
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output 
from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use 
or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without 
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered 
works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for 
you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply 
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control 
copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so 
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit 
them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship 
with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions 
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. 
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any 
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty 
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention 
of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising 
rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any 
intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, 
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention 
of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. 
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any 
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and 
any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact 
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this 
License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer 
support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. 
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from 
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that 
you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a 
relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this 
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the 
requirement in section 4 to keep intact all notices.

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who 
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any 
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, 
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the 
work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have 
separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal 
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display 
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are 
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it 
such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium, is called an aggregate if the compilation and its resulting copyright are 
not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what 
the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not 
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. 
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, 
provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the 
terms of this License, in one of these ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical 
distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable 
physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical 
distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years 
and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product 
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the 
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this 
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a 
price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of 
source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no 
charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to 
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and 
noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in 
accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a 
charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way 
through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy 
the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object 
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server 
(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, 
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find 
the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, 
you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy 
these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other 
peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to 
the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the 
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object 
code work.

A User Product is either (1) a consumer product, which means any tangible personal 
property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) 
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a 
product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, normally used refers to a 
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the 
particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects 
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of 
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

Installation Information for a User Product means any methods, procedures, 
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified 
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its 
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued 
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with 
solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for 
use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the 
right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in 
perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), 
the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the 
Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any 
third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product 
(for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to 
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been 
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been 
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself 
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules 
and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with 
this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an 
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no 
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms. 
Additional permissions are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making 
exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are 
applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this 
License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional 
permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under 
those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without 
regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional 
permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be 
written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You 
may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for 
which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered 
work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the 
terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 
15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions 
in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; 
or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that 
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the 
original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the 
material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, 
trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who 
conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of 
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions 
directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered further restrictions within 
the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, 
contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that 
is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may 
add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, 
provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the 
relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, 
or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a 
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply 
either way.

8. Termination. 
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses 
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a 
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the 
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, 
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means 
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if 
the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is 
the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) 
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your 
receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of 
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights 
have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new 
licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. 
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the 
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of 
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require 
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to 
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. 
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license 
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this 
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this 
License.

An entity transaction is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or 
substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging 
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, 
each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever 
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the 
previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work 
from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with 
reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or 
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, 
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not 
initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging 
that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or 
importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents. 
A contributor is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the 
Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the 
contributor's contributor version.

A contributor's essential patent claims are all patent claims owned or controlled by 
the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be 
infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its 
contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a 
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, control includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license 
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, 
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor 
version.

In the following three paragraphs, a patent license is any express agreement or 
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express 
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To 
grant such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment 
not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the 
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge 
and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or 
other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding 
Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with 
the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream 
recipients. Knowingly relying means you have actual knowledge that, but for the 
patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use 
of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in 
that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, 
or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to 
some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, 
modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based 
on it.

A patent license is discriminatory if it does not include within the scope of its 
coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or 
more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not 
convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is 
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third 
party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the 
third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, 
a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work 
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in 
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, 
unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 
28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied 
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under 
applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. 
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions 
of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey 
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be 
to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or 
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero 
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. 
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered 
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 
13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a 
certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License or any later version 
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU 
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a 
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no 
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of 
your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty. 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES 
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS 
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability. 
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. 
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be 
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local 
law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in 
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies 
a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to 
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone 
can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to 
the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full 
notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> 
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the 
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, 
either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this 
program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when 
it starts in an interactive mode:

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> 
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. 
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of 
the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for 
a GUI interface, you would use an about box.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to 
sign a copyright disclaimer for the program, if necessary. For more information on 
this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into 
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it 
more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is 
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this 
License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

programs. Testing does not include staging on a server in a production environment, 
such as loading content prior
to production use.
b. Included Microsoft Programs. These license terms apply to all Microsoft programs 
included with the software.
If the license terms with any of those programs give you other rights that do not 
expressly conflict with these
license terms, you also have those rights.
c. Third Party Programs. The software contains third party programs. The license terms 
with those programs
apply to your use of them.
3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a. User Testing. Your end users may access the software to perform acceptance tests on 
your programs.
b. Utilities. The software contains certain components that are identified in the 
Utilities List located at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100284. Depending on the specific edition of 
the software, the number of
Utility files you receive with the software may not be equal to the number of 
Utilities listed in the Utilities List. You
may copy and install the Utilities you receive with the software on to a total of five 
(5) machines at any one time.
You may use these Utilities only to debug your programs youve developed with the 
software. You must delete all
the Utilities installed onto a machine within the earlier of (i) when you have 
finished debugging your program; or (ii)
thirty (30) days after installation of the Utilities onto that machine.
c. Distributable Code. The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute 
in programs you develop if
you comply with the terms below.
i. Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are 
Distributable Code.
 REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed in 
REDIST.TXT files,
plus any files listed on the REDIST list located at:
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=100327&clcid=0x409.

distribute the
Distributable Code as part of those programs.
ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
 add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
 for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute only the 
results of running such
Distributable Code through a linker with your program;
 distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as part of that setup 
program without
modification;
 require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at 
least as much as this
agreement;

systems, run-time
technologies or application platforms;
 include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or
 modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of 
it becomes subject to an
Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, 
modification or
distribution, that
 the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
 others have the right to modify it.
4. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the 
software. It may change or
cancel them at any time.
a. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below connect 
to Microsoft or service
provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a 
separate notice when they
connect. BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION.
Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the 
appropriate systems
computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating 
system, browser and name and
version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you 
installed the software.
Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
 Windows Update Feature. You may connect new hardware to the device where you 
installed the software.
Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, 
the update feature of
the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your 
device. You can switch off this
update feature.
 Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from 
Microsoft and provide it to
you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating 
system, name and version
of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where 
you installed the
software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online 
assistance and Appshelp.
You may choose not to use these web content features.
 Real Simple Syndication (RSS) Feed. This software start page contains updated 
content that is supplied by
means of an RSS feed online from Microsoft.
b. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that 
could harm them or impair
anyone elses use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized 
access to any service, data,
account or network by any means.
5. PRODUCT KEYS. The software requires a key to install or access it. You are 
responsible for the use of keys assigned
to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.
6. SQL SERVER BENCHMARK TESTING. You must obtain Microsofts prior written approval to 
disclose to a third party
the results of any benchmark test of the SQL Server software that accompanies this 
software.
7. .NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE. The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework software. 
This software is part of
Windows. The license terms for Windows apply to your use of the .NET Framework 
software.
8. MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING. The software includes the .NET 
Framework component
of the Windows operating systems (.NET Component). You may conduct internal 
benchmark testing of the .NET
Component. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, 
provided that you comply
with the following terms: (1) you must disclose all the information necessary for 
replication of the tests, including
complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test 
scripts/cases, tuning parameters
applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any 
third party testing tool used to
conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is 
developed by or for you and
used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s); (2) you must 
disclose the date (s) that
you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all 
Microsoft software products tested,
including the .NET Component; (3) your benchmark testing was performed using all 
performance tuning and best
practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on Microsofts support 
web sites, and uses the latest
updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft 
operating system; (4) it shall be
sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available 
location such as a website, so long as
every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the 
public site containing all required
disclosures; and (5) nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other 
right that you may have to conduct
benchmark testing. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the 
results of any customized
benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under 
confidentiality in conjunction with a bid
request by a prospective customer, such customers application(s) are specifically 
tested and the results are only
disclosed to such specific customer. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have 
with Microsoft, if you disclose
such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of 
benchmark tests it conducts of your
products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same 
conditions above.
9. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you 
some rights to use the
software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more 
rights despite this limitation, you
may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you 
must comply with any technical
limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For more 
information, see
www.microsoft.com/licensing/userights. You may not
 work around any technical limitations in the software;
 reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the 
extent that applicable law
expressly permits, despite this limitation;
 make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by 
applicable law, despite this
limitation;
 publish the software for others to copy;

CentOS Support Service Agreement for Windows Azure
This OpenLogic Support Agreement is a legal agreement between OpenLogic, Inc., a 
Delaware Corporation ("OpenLogic") and you, either an individual or an entity ("you"). 
If you are an individual, you represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into 
contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this agreement on 
behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that 
entity.  

This agreement governs the support services ("Services") provided to you by OpenLogic 
for designated open source software stacks made available by OpenLogic on Windows 
Azure ("OSS Stacks"). This agreement is effective as of the date you purchased support 
for the OSS Stack(s) ("Effective Date").   

1.   Support Services

OpenLogic will provide technical support for the specific OSS Stacks that Windows 
Azure reports to OpenLogic you have purchased commencing on the Effective Date.  
Technical support includes assistance with problem resolution, defects, and "how to" 
questions as well as advice and recommendations on installation and configuration.  
Support for OSS Stacks will cover only Windows Azure instances on which the stack is 
deployed through the Windows Azure.  It will not cover support of the Windows Azure 
infrastructure or support for the OSS Stacks running on other infrastructure. 

OpenLogic will provide support 12 hours per day between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM EST / EDT, 
five days per week for Developer Support and 24 hours per day, seven days per week for 
Production Support.  Technical support incidents can be submitted via email or by 
phone.  Each single unique defect or question about a Purchased Stack will be counted 
as an incident.  Unless otherwise indicated at the time of purchase, you may submit an 
unlimited number of technical support incidents.  Details about the technical support 
process, response times, types of issues, and severity of issues can be found here 
www.roguewave.com/products-services/services/open-source-software/cloud-
services/azure/service-agreement.

2.   Limitations on Support 

OpenLogic will have no obligation to provide technical support or may cease providing 
the Services in the case of or with respect to any incident that is in whole or in 
part due to, caused by, or resulting from any of the following:

 (i) a breach by you of this Agreement;

 (ii) the operational characteristics of Windows Azure provided hardware, instances, 
or infrastructure;

 (iii) any third party products, software, hardware, equipment, content, data or 
information, and any modifications, improvements, updates, new versions or new 
releases thereto or thereof, not provided by OpenLogic;

 (v) any OSS Stack other than the most current release thereof made available by 
OpenLogic through Windows Azure;

 (vi) use of any OSS Stack after OpenLogic has notified you to cease use thereof under 
this Agreement; or

 (vii) your negligence, abuse, misapplication, or misuse of the OSS Stacks or the 
Services.  

OpenLogic will have no liability for any changes required by your hardware or software 
configuration which may be necessary to use any OSS Stack due to a workaround, error 
correction, or maintenance release.

3.   Fees, Term, and Termination

You will be billed by Windows Azure under the terms of the Windows Azure Customer 
Agreement.  The term of this agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will 
remain in effect until terminated by you or Windows Azure as per the Windows Azure 
Customer Agreement.  The Windows Azure Customer Agreement is located at 
www.roguewave.com/products-services/services/open-source-software/cloud-
services/azure/service-agreement/.

4.   Intellectual Property Rights

 4.1. Intellectual Property Rights.  Intellectual property rights includes, without 
limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, moral 
rights, and any and all other legal rights protecting intangible proprietary 
information ("IPR").  All pre-existing intellectual property rights owned or licensed 
by either party are and will remain the exclusive property of that party.

 4.2. License.  During the term of this Agreement, you may choose to provide OpenLogic 
with access to Your IPR to facilitate OpenLogic in providing the Services, in which 
case you grant to OpenLogic all rights and licenses in and to the Your Technology as 
may be necessary for OpenLogic to complete its obligations under this Agreement.  It 
should be noted that OpenLogic does not have access to Your Technology deployed on 
Windows Azure unless you choose to give OpenLogic access as part of providing the 
Services.  OpenLogic hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide 
license to use, reproduce, and modify any OpenLogic IPR provided to you during the 
course of performing the Services for your own internal business purposes.  To the 
extent any deliverable hereunder is a derivative work, modification, patch, or script 
of or directly relating to an open source software project (each an Open Source 
Deliverable), OpenLogic will license such Open Source Deliverable under the same open 
source software license as the open source project to which it relates.

 4.3. OSS Stacks License. The OSS Stacks are comprised of open source software, which 
is subject to the terms of the open source software license(s) accompanying or 
otherwise applicable to that open source software.  Any other code created and 
supplied directly by OpenLogic is governed by the MIT License.  The terms of the open 
source software licenses apply to the open source software independent of the terms of 
the MIT License or this agreement.  Nothing in this agreement limits your rights under 
or grants rights to you that supersede the terms of any applicable open source 
software license. 

 4.4. You acknowledge that your own distribution or deployment of instances containing 
or linking to the OSS Stacks or any other open source software may trigger open source 
license requirements for which you are responsible.

 4.5. Open Source Community. In the process of providing the Services, OpenLogic 
occasionally finds bugs and errors in open source software as well as issues in how 
certain open source packages work together.  OpenLogic will make best efforts to work 
with open source communities to resolve bugs or defects and contribute those changes 
back for incorporation in future releases.   Due to the nature of open source 
development, OpenLogic can not guarantee that the open source communities will accept 
bug fixes. 

5.   Customer's Comments and Feedback

In the course of OpenLogic providing you with technical support, you may provide 
comments, suggestions, and other feedback regarding the OSS Stacks, the support 
services, or related topics to OpenLogic. You agree that OpenLogic will be free to use 
any such feedback you provide for any purpose, including without limitation 
implementing changes based on your feedback to the OSS Stacks, support,, or other 
offerings without attribution or compensation to you.

6.   Warranties. 

 6.1. General.  Each party represents and warrants to the other party that: the 
performance of such partys obligations hereunder do not and will not violate any law, 
rule or regulation applicable to such party. 

 6.2. OpenLogic.  OpenLogic will perform all Services as stated under this Agreement.  
If OpenLogic fails to comply with the previous sentence, OpenLogic will, at its sole 
discretion and as Clients sole remedy and OpenLogics sole obligation for any such 
failure: (a) re-perform the Services in a manner that resolves the alleged failure; or 
(b) refund any Fees paid by Client attributable to the Services that are the subject 
of the failure. 

7.   Disclaimer

THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 (Warranties) ARE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE 
WARRANTIES MADE BY OPENLOGIC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND OPENLOGIC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS 
ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH 
REGARD TO THE SERVICES, DELIVERABLES AND ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY. 

8.   Limitation of Liability

OPENLOGIC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
INCLUDING, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND 
INJURY TO REPUTATION, EVEN IF OPENLOGIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF OPENLOGIC RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, 
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT 
EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID TO AMAZON BY CLIENT FOR SUPPORT PROVIDED BY OPENLOGIC 
DURING THE 3 MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT(S) GIVING RISE TO SUCH 
LIABILITY. 

9.   Confidential Information.

 9.1. Confidential Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential 
Information means any data or information regarding the business, finances, services 
or technology of either party provided to or otherwise obtained by the other party, 
including, without limitation, technical, marketing, financial, pricing, employee, and 
planning information, and any other data or information received or otherwise obtained 
under this Agreement that a reasonable person should have known, under the 
circumstances, was confidential or proprietary. 

 9.2. Protection.  Each party (the Receiving Party) may from time to time receive or 
otherwise obtain Confidential Information from the other party (the Disclosing 
Party).  The Receiving Party will not use any Confidential Information of the 
Disclosing Party for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement, and will 
disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to the employees or 
contractors of the Receiving Party who have a need to know such Confidential 
Information for purposes of this Agreement and who are under a duty of confidentiality 
no less restrictive than the Receiving Partys duty hereunder.  The Receiving Party 
will protect the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information in the same manner as the 
Receiving Party protects its own confidential information of a similar nature and with 
no less than reasonable care.

 9.3. Exceptions.  The Receiving Partys obligations with respect to any Confidential 
Information of the Disclosing Party will terminate if such information: (a) was 
already lawfully known to the Receiving Party as of the Effective Date; (b) is 
disclosed to the Receiving Party after the Effective Date by a third party who had the 
right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or 
through no fault of the Receiving Party becomes, generally available to the public; or 
(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to, use of, or 
reference to, the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information.  In addition, the 
Receiving Party will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing 
Party to the extent that such disclosure is: (i) necessary for the Receiving Party to 
enforce its rights under this Agreement in connection with a legal proceeding; or (ii) 
required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial, regulatory or 
administrative body, provided that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party 
in advance of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with the 
Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Partys reasonable request and expense, in any 
lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.

10. General

 10.1. Export.    You will comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations in your use of the OSS Stacks.  You represent that you are not barred from 
receiving services under U.S. laws or other applicable jurisdiction, including without 
limitations, the Denied Persons List and the Entity List, and other lists issued by 
the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security.  You represent that 
you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country 
to which the United States has embargoed goods.

 10.2.      Assignment.  This agreement, or any of your rights and obligations under 
this agreement, cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part, and 
any such attempted assignment or transfer by Customer in violation of the foregoing 
will be null and void.

 10.3.      Choice of law.  This agreement will be governed by the laws of the State 
of Colorado in the United States of America, without regard to conflicts of law 
principles.  The federal and state courts located in Denver, Colorado (and any other 
courts having jurisdiction over matters arising in Denver, Colorado) will have 
exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under this agreement and the parties 
hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.  The parties 
agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods is specifically excluded from application to this agreement.

 10.4.      Relationship of parties.  This agreement does not create a partnership, 
franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between you 
and OpenLogic. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.

 10.5.      Waiver.  All waivers under this agreement must be in writing.  Any waiver 
or failure to enforce any provision of this agreement on one occasion will not be 
deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

 10.6.      Severability.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be 
unenforceable, that provision will be modified so as to be enforceable, or if such 
modification is not possible, that provision will be removed and the remaining 
provisions will remain in full force.

 10.7.      Survival.  Sections 4 (Intellectual Property Rights), 5 (Customer's 
Comments and Feedback), 7 (Disclaimer), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Confidential

Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 7 
Attribution Statements
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/

The Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) is 
intended for software developers and vendors to redistribute with
their applications.

The Java SE Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine,
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.
It is not a development environment and does not contain development
tools such as compilers or debuggers.  For development tools, see the
Java SE Development Kit (JDK(TM)).


=======================================================================
     Deploying Applications with the Java SE Runtime Environment
=======================================================================

When you deploy an application written in the Java programming
language, your software bundle will probably consist of the following
parts:

    Your own class, resource, and data files.
    A runtime environment.
    An installation procedure or program.

You already have the first part, of course. The remainder of this
document covers the other two parts. Also see the Developers website:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run your application, a user needs the Java SE Runtime Environment,
which is freely available from Oracle. Or, you can redistribute the
Java SE Runtime Environment for free with your application, according
to the terms of the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java 
SE Platform Products.

The final step in the deployment process occurs when the software is
installed on an individual user's system. Installation consists of copying
software onto the user's system, then configuring the user's system
to support that software.  You should ensure that your installation
procedure does not overwrite existing JRE installations, as they may
be required by other applications.


=======================================================================
      Redistribution of the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)
=======================================================================

    --------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE - The license for this software does not allow the
    redistribution of beta and other pre-release versions.
    --------------------------------------------------------

You may reproduce and distribute the Software (and also portions of
Software identified below as Redistributable), provided that you comply
with the terms and conditions of the Oracle Binary Code License
Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products.

The term "vendors" used here refers to licensees, developers, and
independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and distribute the
Java SE Runtime Environment with their programs.

Vendors must follow the terms of the Java SE Runtime Environment Binary
Code License agreement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required vs. Optional Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The files that make up the Java SE Runtime Environment are divided into
two categories: required and optional.  Optional files may be excluded
from redistributions of the Java SE Runtime Environment at the
vendor's discretion.

The following section contains a list of the files and directories that
may optionally be omitted from redistributions with the Java SE Runtime
Environment.  All files not in these lists of optional files must be
included in redistributions of the runtime environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files may be optionally excluded from redistributions.
These files are located in the jre1.7.0_<version> directory, where
<version> is the update version number.  Solaris and Linux filenames
and separators are shown. Windows executables have the ".exe" suffix.
Corresponding files with _g in the name can also be excluded.
The corresponding man pages should be excluded for any excluded
executables (with paths listed below beginning with bin/ , 
for the Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux). 

   lib/ext/
   sunjce_provider.jar,sunec.jar, sunpkcs11.jar and sunmscapi.jar - JCA/JCE 
   providers for Java Cryptography APIs. Some providers
   are not available on all OS or Architectures. The
   runtime environment must contain at least one implementation
   of each of the required Security algorithms as described in:
   http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/
   security/StandardNames.html
           
   localedata.jar - contains many of the resources 
                    needed for non US English locales
   dnsns.jar - for the InetAddress wrapper of JNDI DNS provider
   bin/rmid [.exe, and .dll on Microsoft Windows]
   Java RMI Activation System Daemon
   bin/rmiregistry
   Java Remote Object Registry
   bin/tnameserv
   Java IDL Name Server
   bin/keytool
   Key and Certificate Management Tool
   bin/kinit [Microsoft Windows]
   Used to obtain and cache Kerberos ticket-granting tickets
   bin/klist [Microsoft Windows]
   Kerberos display entries in credentials cache and keytab
   bin/ktab [Microsoft Windows]
   Kerberos key table manager

When redistributing the JRE on Microsoft Windows as a private
application runtime (not accessible by other applications)
with a custom launcher, the following files are also
optional.  These are libraries and executables that are used
for Java support in Internet Explorer and Mozilla family browsers;
these files are not needed in a private JRE redistribution.

    bin\java.exe
    bin\javaw.exe
    bin\javaws.exe
    bin\javacpl.exe
    bin\jucheck.exe

    lib\deploy\messages_zh_TW.properties
    lib\deploy\splash.jpg 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Redistributable JDK(TM) Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The limited set of files from the Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
listed below may be included in vendor redistributions of the Java SE 
Runtime Environment.  All paths are relative to the top-level
directory of the JDK. The corresponding man pages should be included for
any included executables (with paths listed below beginning with bin/ ,
for the Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux). 

    jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf
        Color profile.  This file is required only if one wishes to
        convert between the PYCC color space and another color space.

    All .ttf font files in the jre/lib/fonts directory. 
        Note that the LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained 
        in the Java SE Runtime Environment, so there is no need to 
        bring that file over from the JDK.

    The javac bytecode compiler, consisting of the following files:
        bin/javac           [Solaris(TM) Operating System
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/javac   [Solaris Operating System
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
    bin/amd64/javac     [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/javac.exe       [Microsoft Windows]
        lib/tools.jar       [All platforms]

    The Annotation Processing Tool, consisting of the following files:
        bin/apt             [Solaris(TM) Operating System
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/apt     [Solaris Operating System
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
    bin/amd64/apt       [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/apt.exe         [Microsoft Windows]

    lib/jconsole.jar
        The Jconsole application.

    jre\bin\server\
        On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both
        the Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM.
        However, the Java SE Runtime Environment for Microsoft Windows
        platforms includes only the Java HotSpot Client VM. Those wishing
        to use the Java HotSpot Server VM with the Java SE Runtime
        Environment may copy the JDK's jre\bin\server folder to a 
        bin\server directory in the Java SE Runtime Environment. Software
        vendors may redistribute the Java HotSpot Server VM with their
        redistributions of the Java SE Runtime Environment.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java
Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the Java SE
Development Kit and the Java SE Runtime Environment allow strong but
limited cryptography to be used.  These files are located at

     <java-home>/lib/security/local_policy.jar
     <java-home>/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar

where <java-home> is the jre directory of the JDK or the
top-level directory of the Java SE Runtime Environment.

An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions
on cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for
those living in eligible countries.  Those living in eligible countries
may download the unlimited strength version and replace the strong
cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The cacerts Certificates File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Root CA certificates may be added to or removed from the Java SE
certificate file located at 

    <java-home>/lib/security/cacerts

For more information, see "The cacerts Certificates File" section
in the keytool documentation at:

http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security

=======================================================================
Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
=======================================================================

From time to time it is necessary to update the Java platform in order
to incorporate newer versions of standards that are created outside of
the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM) http://www.jcp.org/) (Endorsed
Standards), or in order to update the version of a technology included
in the platform to correspond to a later standalone version of that
technology (Standalone Technologies).

The Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism provides a means whereby
later versions of classes and interfaces that implement Endorsed
Standards or Standalone Technologies may be incorporated into the Java
Platform.

For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism,
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to
override, see

      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
