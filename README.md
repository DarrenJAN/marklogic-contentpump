# MarkLogic Content Pump

The project contains MarkLogic Content Pump (MLCP) and MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop (Hadoop Connector).

## Features

MLCP is a command-line tool providing the fastest way to import, export, and copy data to or from MarkLogic databases. Core features of MLCP include:

* Bulk load billions of local files
* Split and load large, aggregate XML files or delimited text
* Bulk load billions of triples or quads from RDF files
* Archive and restore database contents across environments
* Copy subsets of data between databases
* Load documents from HDFS, including Hadoop SequenceFiles
* Leverage Hadoop infrastructure to do above jobs 

Hadoop Connector is an extension to Hadoop's MapReduce framework that allows you to easily and efficiently communicate with a MarkLogic database from within a MapReduce job. Core features of Hadoop Connector include:

* Leverage existing MapReduce and Java libraries to process MarkLogic data
* Operate on data as Documents, Nodes, or Values
* Access MarkLogic text, geospatial, value, and document structure indexes to send only the most relevant data to Hadoop for processing
* Send Hadoop Reduce results to multiple MarkLogic forests in parallel
* Rely on the connector to optimize data access (for both locality and streaming IO) across MarkLogic forests

## Got a question / Need help?

If you have questions about how to use MLCP or Hadoop Connector, you can ask on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlcp). Remember to tag the question with **mlcp** and **marklogic**. There are field experts monitoring tagged questions and ready to help!

## How to Build

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (version >= 3.03) is required to build.

MLCP and Hadoop Connector can be built together. Steps to build:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-contentpump.git
$ cd marklogic-contentpump
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
```
After successful build, product packages can be found in **deliverable** directory under **mlcp** and **mapreduce** folder.

Alternatively, MLCP and Hadoop Connector can be built separately from their own root directory (**mlcp** and **mapreduce**) with above command. Note that MLCP has a dependency on Hadoop Connector. So successfull build of Hadoop Connector is required for building MLCP.

## Run Tests

Unit tests included in MLCP and Hadoop Connector are a minimum set of all the tests we have for the products. They are only designed for sanity check. To run unit tests, under marklogic-contentpump root directory:

``` bash
$ mvn test
```

MLCP tests are run in default mode (distributed or local) based on your environment. For detailed information about running unit tests, visit [Guideline to Run Tests](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-contentpump/wiki/Guideline-to-Run-Tests).
